                                <h4>Excerpt from <em>"Walking Through Brambles: a narrative of
                                        circumspection"</em></h4>

                                <p>I stood on the balcony the following day and watched the winter birds
                                    jump between gargoyles on the parapet. Their dark forms looked like
                                    black spheres balled up into tiny fists of feathers. Their songs
                                    were low and short, but mostly they kept quiet and flew in small,
                                    tight patterns from tree to shrub to fence without making the
                                    slightest sound. The garden and adjacent meadow provided sparse
                                    cover and made no effort to hide them within its own tawny grasses.
                                    Instead, the dark birds took shelter near the ground in leafless
                                    brush resembling nests of crumpled wire.</p>

                                <p>The winter birds held the earth’s spirit. They lived and moved where
                                    nothing else would. I stood inside the doorway and watched them
                                    twitch and peck at seeds and pieces of cracker that I had dropped
                                    for them earlier. They stayed for only a moment. Their eyes moved
                                    about searching for predators that I could not imagine against the
                                    still landscape. Aside from a neighbor’s cat creeping around a light
                                    pole or a hedge of blue-blossom, the dark birds gave the earth its
                                    only motion. They told of the earth’s former personality; they
                                    declared its compassion, warmth, and color.</p>

                                <p>The birds flew off and gathered in the nearby meadow. When they were
                                    still, I could not distinguish them from the shadowy pieces of turf
                                    turned up by the neighbor’s broodmare. The wind was calm and quiet.
                                    I could hear nothing, not even the clock from inside the doorway,
                                    not even a random scraping of branches from the ash and cypress
                                    against the building. Nothing in the garden or in the meadow moved.
                                    The sheer absence of sound and motion gave the moment an eerie
                                    tension. The dark birds and the pale landscape created a loneliness
                                    that wasn’t entire-ly unpleasant. It made me want to sleep, to
                                    envision myself stuffed within a warm bed piled with downy quilts
                                    and pillows. Time never moved more slowly. Fatigue lingered in the
                                    coldness as I fell asleep uncovered in an overstuffed lounge chair
                                    in the middle of the room.</p>

                                <p>I don’t remember dreaming. I only remember waking and feeling
                                    frustrated with my own loneliness and isolation. I wanted to feel
                                    eager again. I wanted to feel renewed and invigorated. I wanted the
                                    artist to be alive, to touch my hand and pull herself into my
                                    embrace. I wanted to feel her desire instead of my own. I wanted to
                                    feel her passion instead of mine. I wanted her wants to be satisfied
                                    in me that I might forget my own wishes and rediscover them anew in
                                    her.</p></div>

                                <h4>Identification and Storytelling:</h4>

                                <h5><em>The Appeal of Franklin Burroughs&rsquo; Narrative Essays</em></h5>

                                <p>In his collection of personal essays entitled, <em>Billy Watson&rsquo;s
                                        Croker Sack</em>, Franklin Burroughs utilizes the genre&rsquo;s
                                    most prevalent rhetorical strategy of identification through story
                                    telling. Unlike the formal essay that may appeal to an audience&rsquo;s
                                    specific interests and curiosities, Burroughs&rsquo; personal essays
                                    often appeal to a general audience&rsquo;s ambivalence between right
                                    and wrong and the environment in which their daily routines are
                                    perceived, rationalized and accepted. He envelopes his readers in a
                                    milieu of personal secrets, selective histories and keen perceptions
                                    of everyday life. Through his candid literary demeanor and his
                                    intimate conversational rhetoric, he positions himself as the <em>everyman</em>.
                                    Burroughs does not assert or praise his credibility; but instead, he
                                    reminds his readers of their universal kinship and the experiences
                                    com&shy;mon to everyone. He attempts to communicate a reasoning that
                                    will casually blend the entire human race into one heterogenous
                                    family. Mainly through stories and anecdotes--the genre&rsquo;s
                                    primary rhetorical devise--Burroughs identifies with a general mass
                                    audience through a reverent conversation of life&rsquo;s minor
                                    generalities and a candid disclosure of his own failures and
                                    emotional fragility.</p>

                                <p>According to Holman and Harmon&rsquo;s <em>A Handbook to
                                        Literature</em>, the personal or informal essay is characterized
                                    by &ldquo;the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes
                                    and experiences, confidential manner)...unconventionality or novelty
                                    of theme...and freedom from stiffness and affectation&rdquo; (Holman
                                    193). In his forward to <em>The Art of the Personal Essay</em>,
                                    Philip Lopate writes that &ldquo;the conversational dynamic--the
                                    desire for contact--is ingrained in the form, and serves to
                                    establish a quick emotional intimacy with the audience&rdquo;
                                    (Lopate 2). These observations are evidenced throughout Burroughs&rsquo;
                                    collection as he discusses life&rsquo;s personality from the
                                    perspective of the provincial New Englander. His collec&shy;tion
                                    consists of five essays all evaluating and reacting to the
                                    complexities of life and death in modern but rural America. He
                                    describes a local dimension of life that is free of the world&rsquo;s
                                    abrasive competitiveness, and he involves his readers in
                                    <em>his</em> world--a separate reality where he can confess his own
                                    fears and inadequacies.</p>

                                <p>Recollections of boyhood and descriptions of the land&shy;scape are
                                    inherent in Burroughs&rsquo; essays. The innocence of childhood and
                                    nature &ldquo;undefiled&rdquo; is discussed in a homey,
                                    unpretentious rhetoric that appeals to the simple, unrefined,
                                    child-like qualities of his audience. He elaborates on the hillside&rsquo;s
                                    weeds and grasses and in a neighborly editorial on the weather, he
                                    discusses nature&rsquo;s routines and his own droll attitudes of
                                    home. &ldquo;Crackers limp as old lettuce,&rdquo; an expres&shy;sion
                                    bordering clich&eacute; is placidly expressed by a narrative voice
                                    which at times can be equally clich&eacute; or banal--simple,
                                    unashamed but heroically sincere (Burroughs 5). It is easy for one
                                    to imagine the author as a quiet, non-threatening figure draped in
                                    loose fitting overalls, standing upon the seat of his tractor,
                                    gazing at the valley before him as he describes &ldquo;our fields,&rdquo;
                                    in the following detail:</p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 60px;">The stitchwort, vetch, buttercup,
                                    bedstraw and blue-eyed grass...thriving amid the adversities of soil
                                    and climate, their inconspicuous beauty seems reflective of rural
                                    New England, and it is pleasing to learn that people here once found
                                    more than aesthetic solace in them (Burroughs 9).</p>

                                <p>He further appeals to his and his audience&rsquo;s commonness in
                                    describing his &ldquo;Southern boyhood&rdquo; that was filled
                                    with &ldquo;that strange Wordsworthian hunger for landscape&rdquo;
                                    (Burroughs 10). Certainly by the end of the tenth page, readers can
                                    identify with Burroughs&rsquo; natural, uncomplicated
                                    self-portrait.</p>

                                <p>Throughout most of his book, Burroughs presents himself (as Edmund
                                    Waller may have noted 350 years ago) as the self-sequestered man. He
                                    is alone and removed from the rest of the world where he can observe
                                    man and nature unnoticed. And it is during this seclusion when
                                    Burroughs receives these random and quixotic perceptions and
                                    insights into everyday life. Lopate again in his forward to <em>The
                                        Art of the Personal Essay</em> informs us of the essayist as one
                                    who &ldquo;claims unique access to the small, humble things in life&rdquo;
                                    (Lopate 5). Bur&shy;roughs certainly attempts to portray this
                                    affection early in his collection and it is evidenced throughout the
                                    entire book. Lopate also notes that &ldquo;this taste for the
                                    miniature becomes a strong suit of the form: the ability to turn
                                    anything close at hand...into a grand meditation adventure&rdquo;
                                    (Lopate 9).</p>

                                <p>Burroughs is very much attuned to the quiet, ambient side of life,
                                    and although he doesn&rsquo;t embellish as much as other narrative
                                    writers may, he more closely scrutinizes the minia&shy;ture and
                                    discusses what most of us would consider unneces&shy;sary. This is
                                    particularly clear as he describes his activities on the opening day
                                    of duck hunting season.&nbsp;</p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 60px;">The day faded on into ordinariness; it
                                    would regain a little of its special quality only after supper, when
                                    I would go out into the barn, pluck the teal and dress them, watched
                                    by Mink and Mrs. Pino, our two semi-domestic cats. Then would clean
                                    the gun, swabbing out the barrels until they shone like mirrors when
                                    I held them to the light and looked through them. Would carefully
                                    save a few of the flank feathers and a wing for trout flies; would
                                    reward the cats with a visceral morsel; would wrap and label the
                                    ducks and put them in the freezer. That would be it, an annual
                                    observance completed (Burroughs 103).</p>

                                <p>By omitting the subject of the final four phrases, Burroughs omits
                                    <em>himself</em> to suggest that even <strong><em>he</em></strong>
                                    is perhaps too obvious to mention and too ordinary to even care.
                                    This is a clear rhetori&shy;cal strategy that reiterates the event&rsquo;s
                                    repetitive calculation. It also appears from this final sentence
                                    that even the author, caught up in the rush of tradition and local
                                    patriotism, honors an observance of which he is morally uncertain.
                                    He therefore confronts, with some reservation, the moral challenges
                                    and social obligations that most people will at some time encoun&shy;ter.
                                    But his stories, more than anything, present the author as a
                                    regular-kind-of-guy. He is simple, honest and kind. The natural
                                    intimacy of his narrative is powerfully inviting to the individual
                                    who also perceives himself as a regular-kind-of-guy.</p>

                                <p>Burroughs is fascinated with milieu and the pace at which he moves
                                    his thoughts within it. His rambling stream of consciousness is not
                                    specifically a rhetorical treatment but is certainly a rhetorical
                                    style that allows him to ponder his own perceptions and color them
                                    according to his current mood or voice. Each essay within the
                                    collection relates significantly to this milieu and to the author&rsquo;s
                                    place within the natural world. This is particularly evident in the
                                    following passage from Burroughs&rsquo; third essay.</p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 60px;">It always seemed to be somewhere in the
                                    middle of a summer afternoon. Floors being cooler than rugs or beds.
                                    I would lie on the floor in front of an oscillating fan, its breeze
                                    passing over me, going away, hesitating at the end of its arc,
                                    returning (Burroughs 47).&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>Again, Burroughs&rsquo; story appeals to our sense of calm-ness--a
                                    stagnation in time where he pauses to study the rhythm of an arcing
                                    fan to a degree that permits him to reflect on the transience and
                                    immediate purpose of his own life. His description of the plain
                                    implies that the author is never beyond the common and ordinary,
                                    that he is merely a random creation of nature and a victim of its
                                    indifference. But his narrative also suggests a balance and
                                    proportion for a life that is consumed with business and worldly
                                    responsibilities. Consider how his audience might relate or identify
                                    with the following passage.</p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 60px;">So I would relapse into the Upper
                                    Peninsula, making it my refuge for another empty summer afternoon,
                                    while the fan hummed and the cicadas outside buzzed their parched,
                                    whetstone song, lapping and overlap&shy;ping itself in slow waves,
                                    until at last dusk fell, a faint coolness seeped out from the grass,
                                    and the toads and crickets took over (Burroughs 48).</p>

                                <p>Even if his reader never makes it to the mountains in Wyo&shy;ming or
                                    the backwoods of Kentucky, he has no trouble envisioning the comfort
                                    and peace of the places Burroughs describes.&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>Aside from these hum-drum normalities of life, Burroughs admits his
                                    failures and accepts his inadequacies as another facet of life and
                                    another dimension of nature. His life and reputation is circumspect.
                                    He is bound to provincial exclu&shy;sion. His rhetoric is plaintive
                                    and describes a man bullied by ambition and made common by
                                    circumstance and history. This attitude develops as his past is
                                    remembered while fishing one morning in a small New England
                                    pond.</p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 60px;">I was bookish and introverted as a boy,
                                    lived more in theory than among facts, and always waited on a time
                                    when my circumstances would at last conform to what was prescribed
                                    by authors, and deliver me from an identity which, whether measured
                                    against my own standards, or against the modest and sensible expecta&shy;tions
                                    of my parents, was ignominious. I read all about fishing:...the
                                    throwline, the cork, and a cricket or caterpillar on the hook came
                                    to seem too much like what I feared my life would be--something
                                    local, undistinguished, and limited, beneath the notice of
                                    literature and without shape or certification (Burroughs 54-55).</p>

                                <p>While we are meant to understand Burroughs&rsquo; disillusion&shy;ment
                                    with life, we are also intended to relate to his queerish boyhood in
                                    order to find a perspective for <strong><em>our</em></strong>
                                    queerish natures. Lopate explains it this way. &ldquo;The trick is
                                    to realize that one is not important, except insofar as one&rsquo;s
                                    example can serve to elucidate a more widespread human trait and
                                    make readers feel a little less lonely and freakish&rdquo; (Lopate
                                    6).&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>Further insight into Burroughs&rsquo; audience can be seen in how the
                                    author represents himself and in his subtextual description of the
                                    reader with whom he attempts to identify. In the previous citation,
                                    Burroughs confesses a fear in becom&shy;ing or remaining &ldquo;local,
                                    undistinguished and limited.&rdquo; But a more attentive reading
                                    suggests that Burroughs, in his effort to identify, may actually
                                    alienate or distance himself from his general audience by suggesting
                                    that they too are &ldquo;local, undistinguished and limited.&rdquo;
                                    If we initially accept Burroughs&rsquo; appeal to an unsophisticated
                                    and general mass audience, we must also accept his reader&rsquo;s
                                    general and unsophisticated identitiy within his respective
                                    community. Consider for a moment how the local school principal may
                                    perceive himself within his own community and also consider how the
                                    <em>local</em> minister, sales clerk or secretary may identify with
                                    Burroughs&rsquo; &ldquo;uncertified&rdquo; classification. Is it
                                    unfair for us to assume that his readers have similar perspectives
                                    of their own provincial limitations and inadequacies that Burroughs
                                    infers?</p>

                                <p>Perhaps the most accurate analysis of Burroughs&rsquo; audience lies
                                    in the nature of his confessions itself. Perhaps these personal
                                    confessions are intended not exclusively for a general readership
                                    but for Burroughs himself. For most personal essayists, writing is
                                    therapy--purging, through confession and self-confrontation, the
                                    loneliness and despair that they often see in themselves. In this
                                    respect, it is reason&shy;able to believe that Burroughs is still
                                    reaching within himself for a deeper understanding of the local and
                                    undistinguished persona that his essays display. It is equally
                                    reasonable to suspect that, <em>Billy Watson&rsquo;s Croker
                                        Sack</em> is a testament of the author&rsquo;s attempt to
                                    identify with <em>himself</em> and not solely with an
                                    unsophisticated, unassuming and undistinguished regional audience.
                                    Burroughs himself may indeed be the collection&rsquo;s primary
                                    audience.</p>

                                <p>Burroughs&rsquo; rhetoric is free of fancy terms, specialized jargon
                                    and gothic analogies and metaphors. Rather his anecdotes and stories
                                    become his predominant rhetorical pulse. Within these stories he
                                    appeals to his audience&rsquo;s romantic moods and is able to use
                                    their sensitivities to justify their telling. In some instances, his
                                    milieu of melancholy and nostalgia is so morose that one reads his
                                    confessions with a measure of pity and responsibility for the author&rsquo;s
                                    bad luck and failure to succeed. Perhaps Burroughs is only
                                    interested in communicating what Gore Vidal has said about narrative
                                    literature. &ldquo;The true confessors have been aware that not only
                                    is life mostly failure, but that in one&rsquo;s failure or pettiness
                                    or wrongness exists the living drama of the self&rdquo; (Lopate
                                    9).</p>

                                <p>At times, Burroughs&rsquo; dependence upon his readers&rsquo;
                                    sympathy is excessive. After all, as Donald Harwood puts it, &ldquo;we
                                    all have our little sorrows&rdquo; and certainly Burroughs, like the
                                    rest of us, must deal with his personal traumas alone (Harwood 33).
                                    But as Lopate further explains, the personal essayist &ldquo;is not
                                    necessarily out to win the audience&rsquo;s unquali&shy;fied love
                                    but to present the complex portrait of a human being&rdquo; (Lopate
                                    8). And so Burroughs&rsquo; stories reflect the complexity of the
                                    <em>human</em> character, and the rhetorical treat&shy;ment he uses
                                    to identify with his audience, mainly gentle first-person story
                                    telling, reflects the complexities of the <em>poetical</em>
                                    character--something that even the most common among us hopes to
                                    possess.</p>

                                <p>Burroughs&rsquo; text is rich with simple and plain observations made
                                    extraordinary only by the care of their telling. The author elevates
                                    his subject through his personal rhetoric and his intuitive vision
                                    of the common man. And the common man who becomes acquainted with
                                    <em>Billy Watson&rsquo;s Croker Sack </em>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily
                                    escape in a rhetoric of elevated propor&shy;tions but is shown how
                                    his ordinariness is made grand in the perspective that Burroughs
                                    gives it. Irish essayist Hubert Butler explains it this way: &ldquo;I
                                    am more inclined to apologize for writing about great events, which
                                    touched me not at all, than for tracing again the tiny snail track
                                    which I made myself&rdquo; (Lopate 10). Great or insignificant
                                    events in them&shy;selves cannot dictate the types of rhetorical
                                    treatments that a writer may employ in achieving his or her
                                    purposes. But in the genre of the personal narrative, the primary
                                    rhetorical emphasis is placed on the writer&rsquo;s ability to
                                    identify with his audience. And according to Burroughs&rsquo; style
                                    and subject matter, one cannot overlook his perspective of the
                                    little, ubiquitous happenings that many of us no longer notice. For
                                    this reason, Burroughs identifies easily with his readers, and his
                                    story-telling style assures him of a certain reader loyalty and
                                    trust that other writers may not enjoy.</p>

                                    The bay breezes through my room, <br/>
                                    and a pen rolls across the bureau <br/>
                                    so, so slowly <br/>
                                    while a note glides lightly, gently <br/>
                                    to the foot of my bed. <br/>
                                    Green springs trickle through the bamboo <br/>
                                    knocking against the porch <br/>
                                    as though it were wrapped <br/>
                                    in a pillow. <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    The bright night illuminates; <br/>
                                    and just beyond the tide&rsquo;s reaching touch <br/>
                                    the dunes bow softly into the hillside. <br/>
                                    jasmine and willow sway above the pond <br/>
                                    where a turtle&mdash; <br/>
                                    high priest of this garden, <br/>
                                    rests like me on a ripple <br/>
                                    of circumspection: <br/>
                                    a meditation, a prayer <br/>
                                    a thought not born into speech. <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    A toad bellows low in the reed beds, <br/>
                                    fireflies linger in the air; <br/>
                                    and a dandelion ascends <br/>
                                    as some do in September <br/>
                                    rising into the dark light. <br/>
                                    The fat yellow moon pulls his eyelids down, <br/>
                                    the warm silver ghost cups me in her hands, <br/>
                                    bliss dripping like dew from her fingers <br/>
                                    and I succumb to her relentless serenity&mdash; <br/>
                                    the unsparing comfort of sedation. <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    Like footsteps on the bare floor, <br/>
                                    the clock taps out a beat&mdash; <br/>
                                    the pulse of nature, <br/>
                                    of some divinity <br/>
                                    nesting somewhere near; <br/>
                                    a mass for the living <br/>
                                    blessed in its subjectivity, <br/>
                                    mercy and compassion. <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    And almost like a memory <br/>
                                    from a terrace down the hill, <br/>
                                    a spanish guitar floats its voices here <br/>
                                    unplugged from the dissonance of age <br/>
                                    coming humbly, joyfully home&mdash; <br/>
                                    <em>all of life's perfections</em> <br/>
                                    <em>distilled to its finest hour</em> <br/>
                                    <em>is now</em>. <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    The wind loosens the drapes <br/>
                                    unfolding like wings in the doorway <br/>
                                    as the restful turtle hums <br/>
                                    and a leaf drifts by <br/>
                                    so, so slowly... <br/>

                                    in the natural light from which I see no source

                                    can feel the cool crumbs of dust
