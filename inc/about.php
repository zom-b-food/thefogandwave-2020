					<p>Well, let's see. I gasped my first breath the Sunday evening of January 20,
						19-something. Don't ask me my age unless you're prepared to believe a lie. I
						grew up
						in Texas and Indiana where I rode motorcycles through corn fields, paddled
						canoes
						over waterfalls, dreamed of being a poet--an expatriate living in a far and
						distant
						land. I went to college in Utah and Texas and have a BA in Theatre and another
						one
						in English (composition & rhetoric). I lived in New York City for a while and
						attended the National Shakespeare Conservatory but dropped out after spending
						all of
						my student-aid money on 2-months rent, a plate of eggs benedict, and a
						basketball. I
						know, crazy, right? Why did I buy a basketball?</p>

					<p>I worked as a technical editor for a publishing company in NYC. Recently married,
						we lived in a tiny "artsy" (meaning mouse and roach infested) studio in Gramercy
						Park. A couple of years later, our beautiful daughter was born and we moved to
						Texas where I went to work for its democratic governor. And suddenly I
						discovered that I was a closet socialist and then summarily "fired" when Bush
						came to town. I spent my early career looking for a career. Spent my mid-career
						trying to resuscitate my first career and soon thereafter settled into my
						current career that felt like coming to after falling down the balcony stairs. I
						pass the time with my work and do it fairly well. Initially, however, I wanted to write
						novels on a beach in Northern Africa or make cheese out of a wagon while
						traveling with gypsies, but I was pressed into a real job due to the above
						mentioned child and a delinquent student loan.</p>

					<p>I've always believed that life is a journey as depicted by the tiny rune tattooed
						on
						my hand. And so I aim to journey on without the
						pathos of a martyr looking over his shoulder at an image blurred by age and
						remorse.
						I try to guide my life by that tiny voice within me struggling each day to sever
						myself from ego. I hope to
						obtain someday the wise dignity of an artist or a scholar; always pressing
						forward
						like everyman--going to work, paying the bills, feeding the family, reasoning
						his
						way through days that go on and on like rain dripping down a mountain.</p>
