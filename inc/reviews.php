                  <p>The author's writing style is intimate and more poetry than prose to me. I found particularly delightful his perceptive descriptions of the character's relationship with his environment, and his willingness to be in the moment.</p>

                  <p>Walking Through Brambles by G. W. Latimer was a relaxing escape, and so much funnier than I expected. From his observations about yellow cat and fatherhood to his day to day life at the library, his observations and dry sense of humor had me laughing several times. I can see how many might miss the humor, but it's there and so rewarding. This book reads more like a diary or journal than a novel, but I took to reading it at night before bed. The authors' voice is calming--a perfect end to a busy day in this noisy and often stressful world. </p>

                  <p>This is definitely a different style and not for everyone- it's more like reading a beautiful journal someone has left behind. The descriptions are beautiful and exquisite. It's a place I'd want to visit and a life I'd enjoy living!
                    I liked this book & I would read more from the writer in the future.</p>

                    <p>This narrative reads more like light-hearted poetry. The graceful descriptions of space, time, light, dust, foliage, elements, pets and people were all masterfully written. I found myself wanting to be in the small Oregon coastal town, among its quirky inhabitants.</p>
