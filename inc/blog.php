						<h4>Quantum Bubbles Rising</h4>

						<p>My next book describes consciousness as the matter within a bubble and follows this
							consciousness as it rises from the bottom of the sea
							to it's release into the atmosphere. I think of the bubble as a womb, like the earth
							as a womb for all of us. The bubble holds us, nurtures and teaches us, carries us
							into maturity until we rise to the top and are born into the universe.

						<p>I am the cold grey of a turning sea
							<br />the stillness of a warm bay--
							<br />a balmy sedation
							<br />subtle as glass.

						</p>
						<p>I am the room between thoughts
							<br />the distance between words
							<br />the infinite rests of an unfinished song
							<br />the echo of a mayfly's whisper.

						</p>
						<p>I am the first breath of sleep
							<br />the next tick of an unwound clock
							<br />the last seductive secret;
							<br />I am the ubiquitous space between.
